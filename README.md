To get Burger Bar locally:
1. Clone the Github repository onto your local computer.
2. Using Git Bash or another CLI, navigate to the project's root directory and type 'npm install'.
3. Create a .env file. It will have only two lines:
```
DB_USER=*
DB_PASS=*
```
Replace the asterisks with your own local database username and password.
4. In your Git Bash or other CLI, again ensure that it is running the project's root directory and type, without the quotes, "node server.js". Press enter.
5. Open your preferred browser - ideally Chrome or Firefox. In the address bar, type "localhost:8080" and hit enter. Welcome to Burger Bar!
